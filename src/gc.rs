//! `hestia gc`: mark/sweep garbage collection over the GHA cache.
//!
//! Runs as a scheduled workflow on the default branch.
//! The flow is split into a read-only **plan** (which doubles as `--dry-run`
//! output) and an **execute** phase made of individually resumable steps:
//!
//! ```text
//! ① Reconcile   REST list "pack-*" → packs GitHub already evicted → drop
//!               their chunk locations; affected paths are healed (dropped;
//!               they re-upload from the local store on the next push)
//! ② Mark        paths reachable from live roots → last_reachable = now
//! ③ Sweep       roots not updated within RootTTL → drop
//!               paths unreachable AND out of PathGrace AND out of PushTTL → drop
//! ④ Plan        per pack: liveness = live chunk bytes / total bytes
//!               liveness < MinLiveness or too many volatile packs → repack
//!               fully live but idle packs → touch (1-byte Range read)
//! ⑤ Execute     Range-copy verified frames → upload new packs → commit
//!               manifest (SaveMutable; re-plan on conflict) → REST DELETE
//!               unprotected garbage packs and orphans
//! ```
//!
//! Crash-safe ordering: replaced packs stay referenced by the manifest until
//! the commit lands; only then are they deleted. A crash at any point leaves
//! either the old state or a state the next GC run converges from (orphaned
//! uploads are cleaned by the orphan sweep once they are old enough).
//!
//! Deletion is deferred and double-guarded (design model-checked in
//! `docs/gc.als`):
//!
//! * **Version protection**: packs referenced by *any surviving manifest
//!   version* are never deleted. A drain commit can only resurrect
//!   references from one of those versions, so garbage survives one extra
//!   run instead of being deleted out from under a concurrent drain.
//! * **Recency**: packs created *or accessed* within min_age are never
//!   deleted, because a drain may have just uploaded or CAS-touched them
//!   without having committed yet. Recency is re-checked with a fresh
//!   listing right before the REST deletes.
