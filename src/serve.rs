//! `hestia serve`: the per-job daemon.
//!
//! Two servers share one process:
//!
//! * the post-build-hook listener (unix socket): buffers locally-built
//!   paths and uploads them on drain;
//! * the substituter (HTTP): serves previously cached paths back to Nix.
//!
//! They are coupled through two pieces of shared state: the [`AccessLog`]
//! (substituter records narinfo hits, drains turn them into GC roots) and
//! the [`ManifestStore`] (drains publish newly pushed paths, the
//! substituter serves them without a restart).
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! bind hook socket + substituter listener (manifest loads concurrently)
//!   add     -> buffer paths in memory
//!   drain   -> run the write pipeline over buffered + accessed paths
//!              -> refresh the served manifest
//!   status  -> report buffered count
//!   narinfo -> record access
//!   nar     -> serve chunks fetched from packs
//! exit on: shutdown signal (SIGTERM/SIGINT) or idle timeout
//!   -> one final drain before returning
//! ```
//!
//! Buffered paths live in memory only: on ephemeral CI runners, a
//! persistent queue would not survive the job either, and lost
//! registrations self-correct (the path is rebuilt and re-registered next
//! run).
