This action runs [hestia](https://github.com/Mic92/hestia) inside your job,
turning the GitHub Actions cache into a Nix binary cache.

When the job starts, the action:

1. Captures the Actions cache API tokens (`ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`,
   `ACTIONS_RESULTS_URL`, and `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` on v1 forges). They are
   only visible to JS actions, which is why hestia needs an action at all
   and cannot be set up from `run:` steps.
2. Installs the `hestia` binary, either from a GitHub release (verified
   against GitHub's build attestations) or from a path you built yourself.
3. Starts the hestia daemon: a post-build-hook listener plus a local
   substituter speaking the Nix binary cache protocol over HTTP.
4. Wires both into a private `nix.conf` (`extra-substituters` with
   `?trusted=true`, `post-build-hook`) registered via `NIX_USER_CONF_FILES`.
   No nix-daemon restart; on multi-user installs the runner user must be in
   `trusted-users` for the hook to fire (GitHub-hosted runners are).

When the job ends, a post step drains the daemon: everything that was built
is chunked, packed, and uploaded, and the manifest is committed to the GHA
cache.

## Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      actions: read         # optional: detect evicted cache entries upfront
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - uses: NixOS/nix-installer-action@main
      - uses: Mic92/hestia/action@v1
      - run: nix build .#
```

Later runs substitute what earlier runs built instead of rebuilding it.

### Using a locally built binary

If you build hestia yourself, while hacking on it or because you do not want
to trust release binaries, pass a path instead:

```yaml
      - run: nix build github:Mic92/hestia -o hestia-bin
      - uses: Mic92/hestia/action@v1
        with:
          binary: ./hestia-bin/bin/hestia
```

### Token capture only

With both `version` and `binary` explicitly set to empty strings, the
action only exports the cache API tokens and starts nothing (`version`
defaults to `latest` when omitted, so a bare invocation starts a daemon):

```yaml
      - uses: Mic92/hestia/action@v1
        with:
          version: ""
```

This mode is for setups that run hestia themselves; hestia's own
integration tests use it.

### Gitea / Forgejo (cache v1)

Gitea and Forgejo implement the older cache v1 API
(`_apis/artifactcache`) instead of GitHub's v2 API. On those forges, pass a
locally built binary and set `HESTIA_CACHE_API_V1` so the daemon speaks v1:

```yaml
      - uses: Mic92/hestia/action@v1
        with:
          binary: ./hestia-bin/bin/hestia
        env:
          HESTIA_CACHE_API_V1: "1"
```

The action exports `ACTIONS_CACHE_URL` alongside the runtime token; the
daemon uses it when `HESTIA_CACHE_API_V1` is set.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `binary` | — | Path to a pre-built hestia binary. Takes precedence over `version`. |
| `version` | latest release | Release tag to download (e.g. `v1.0.0`). The download is verified against GitHub's build attestations. |
| `github-token` | `${{ github.token }}` | Token for downloading the release (needed for private-repo releases) and the attestation lookup. |
| `github-api-url` | runner env | Base URL of the GitHub REST API for release/attestation lookups (e.g. `https://ghes.example.com/api/v3`). |
| `github-server-url` | runner env | Base URL the hestia release binary is downloaded from. Override to pull from a different host than the runner's. |
| `listen` | free port per invocation | Substituter listen address. |
| `socket` | per-invocation temp path | Post-build-hook unix socket path. |
| `drain-timeout` | `300` | Seconds the post-job step waits for the final upload. |
| `upstream-cache-filter` | `false` | Skip paths signed by an upstream cache instead of caching them (saves quota for big closures). |
| `upstream-cache-key-names` | `cache.nixos.org-1` | Space-separated key names treated as upstream caches by the filter. |
| `filter-drv-closures` | `false` | Apply the upstream filter to registered derivation closures; requires `upstream-cache-filter`. Use `hestia prefetch` for bulk closure fetching. |
| `read-only` | `false` | Substitute from the cache but never write to it (no post-build-hook, no drain). |
| `no-closure` | `false` | Cache built paths only, without their runtime closure. |

`HESTIA_CACHE_API_V1` is not an action input but an environment variable:
set it to any value to make hestia speak the cache v1 API on Gitea/Forgejo
(pair with `binary:`); unset keeps the v2 default.

## Garbage collection

The cache needs a periodic GC run on the default branch: PR-scoped caches die
with their branch, but the default branch scope grows forever unless
something prunes it. Copy
[`.github/workflows/gc.yml`](../.github/workflows/gc.yml) from the hestia
repository as a starting point.

## Permissions

The job needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  actions: read     # optional: detect evicted cache entries upfront
```

Cache uploads need no scope: they authenticate with the runner-injected
`ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`. Only the GC workflow's cache deletes need
`actions: write`.
